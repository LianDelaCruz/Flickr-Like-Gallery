# Flickr-Like-Gallery

Hi There! 

Here's another gallery but more of exploration. I added animation from https://animejs.com/ :)
Yes, yes, I know it doesn't look as beautiful as you expected, but I focused more on the technical part, also: am still a baby programmer! :D 

Anyways, this webpage has HTML, CSS, Javascript, animation from anime.js, and very simple fetch of an API. 
Feel free to check out my other repos! And here is a link to my LinkedIn if you're insterested: https://www.linkedin.com/in/liandelacruz/


NOTE: Background color changes in every mouse move so you know. :)

Thank you!!
