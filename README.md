Hi There! 	:wave:

### What the project does? 
Here's another gallery but more of exploration. This project fetches data from an API and I added animation from https://animejs.com/ :sunglasses:
Yes, yes, I know it doesn't look as beautiful as you expected, but I focused more on the technical part, also: am still a baby programmer! :D 
Anyways, this webpage has HTML, CSS, Javascript, animation from anime.js, and very simple fetch of an API. :sparkles:

### Why is the project useful? 
It is useful for educational purposes, and it can give you photos you want. 

### Who maintains and contributes to the project?
It is I who contributed to this project. :raising_hand_woman:


**NOTE:** Background color changes in every mouse move for people who are photosensitive. :rotating_light:

Thank you!!
